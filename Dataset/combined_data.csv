Eat a variety of foods from the five food groups: fruits, vegetables, grains, protein foods, and dairy.
Eat the right amount of food to maintain a healthy weight.
Choose foods low in saturated fat, sodium (salt), and added sugars.

Do not eat or drink the following foods:

Raw eggs or foods that contain raw eggs, for example, homemade cookie dough
Raw or undercooked poultry, meat, and seafood
Unpasteurized milk or dairy products and fruit juices
Follow the four basic steps to food safety: clean, separate, cook, and chill.

Clean: Wash your hands, cooking utensils, and countertops often when preparing foods.
Separate: Separate foods to prevent the spread of any germs from one food to another. For example, keep raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs separate from foods that are ready to eat, including fruits, vegetables, and breads.
Cook: Use a food thermometer to make sure that foods are cooked to safe temperatures.
Chill: Refrigerate or freeze meat, poultry, eggs, seafood, or other foods that are likely to spoil within 2 hours of cooking or purchasing.

allergy.txt,"Yogurt and food with live cultures
Even though studies have not specifically targeted which probiotics and other ""good bacteria"" combat allergies, studies have shown probiotics may be a promising boost for allergy prevention and treatment. Studies have also shown probiotics and ""good bacteria"" help regulate and strengthen your immune system as ""good bacteria"" and flora in our bodies can affect our immune responses positively.

Turmeric
Turmeric is commonly thought to help with allergies because it contains curcumin. Research has shown curcumin can stop the production of some inflammatory molecules in mice. One study even suggests that humans might reduce allergic rhinitis symptoms with daily turmeric consumption.

Apples
An apple a day may actually help keep allergies away because apples are high in quercetin. Quercetin is found in other foods such as berries, capers, grapes, cabbage, cauliflower, onions (especially red onions), shallots, tea and tomatoes. Quercetin can help the body fight allergies because of its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiviral properties.

Fish
Omega-3 fatty acids are found in two common fish: tuna and salmon. The omega-3 fatty acids in these fish may help protect against inflammatory conditions such as allergies. Omega-3 fatty acids can also be found in walnuts and flaxseed.

chronic cholestasis.txt,"You can help your liver function better during the stress of pregnancy and cholestasis by following some simple dietary recommendations:

Eat plenty of protein. Your liver is responsible for making many blood proteins. You can help by making sure you get key amino acids found in foods high in protein. You can learn more about how much protein to eat during pregnancy here.
Eat foods with medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). Fats absorb very poorly when the bile flow has slowed or stopped. The only fats that absorb relatively easily are medium-chain fatty acids, found in higher concentrations in coconut oil and palm kernel oil. Other types of fats should be reduced in your diet as they are poorly absorbed and contribute to GI upset.
Consume extra fiber. Toxins in your food can be absorbed by the gut and because your liver is sluggish, it can't break them down as easily. Fiber helps bind toxins so that you aren't as affected by them.
Eat foods high in vitamin K. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that needs bile to be absorbed. You need this vitamin for the effective clotting of blood. In order to get enough vitamin K absorbed when you have cholestasis, you should consume more than you normally would. Leafy greens like spinach and collard greens are great choices.
Eat extra omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids will be more challenging to absorb with cholestasis of pregnancy. Do your best by eating foods that have mostly this type of healthy fat. These include fish, nuts, and seeds.

Foods to avoid with cholestasis
High-fat foods, High-sugar foods, Refined complex carbs, Alcohol and Foods from Dirty Dozen (unless organic)

drug reaction.txt,"Diet for Drug Reaction

Green, leafy vegetables, which are high in vitamin K, can decrease how well aspirin thins the blood. Consuming the same amount of green-leafy vegetables each day will decrease this interaction.

Grapefruit juice alters the way the body absorbs statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs) like Lipitor in the blood. It can cause these drugs to be absorbed in higher than normal amounts resulting in a greater risk of side effects.

Calcium channel blockers are prescribed for high blood pressure and are also affected by grapefruit juice. Grapefruit juice changes the way this drug breaks down in the body and may cause overly high levels of the drug in the blood, raising the risk of side effects. 

Dairy products such as milk, yogurt and cheese decrease the absorption of antibiotics. Try to eat meals one to two hours before taking these to avoid this interaction.

Alcohol affects insulin or oral diabetic pills. Alcohol prolongs the effects of these drugs, which leads to low blood sugar.

fungal infection.txt,"Home Remedies For Fungal Infection are:

1. Eat Yoghurt and Probiotics
Yoghurt and other probiotics have an ample amount of good bacteria that help stave off many fungal infections. These fight off microbes that cause these
infections. Fermented foods are another excellent source of probiotics. If these are not helping, you could use probiotic supplements that have more concentrated dosages of good bacteria.

2. Wash with Soap and Water
Clean the affected area with soap and water twice daily before you apply any home remedies or any other medication. This will control the spread of infection. While soap and water may not always be able to eliminate a fungal infection entirely, it helps to keep the spread down and lower the intensity of the infection.

Apple cider vinegar has antifungal properties. You could mix two tablespoons in warm water and drink it up or dip a cotton ball in it and dab over your skin. Doing this thrice a day should produce beneficial results.

Experts recommend following a Mediterranean diet or a similar dietary pattern rich in fruit, vegetables, and whole grains to reduce GERD symptoms. Some sample meal ideas include:

oatmeal with berries
poached eggs on whole grain toast
avocado on whole grain toast
mixed salad greens with whole grain pita bread and hummus
brown rice with steamed vegetables and salmon
whole grain bread sandwich with tuna and grilled vegetables
whole grain pizza with pesto sauce, vegetables, and low fat cheese
baked skinless chicken with grilled vegetables and baby potatoes
grilled vegetable skewers with hummus dip and salad

Treatments
The symptoms of GERD are highly treatable.

People can purchase over-the-counter (OTC) medications to treat GERD. These include antacids, such as Gaviscon, which neutralize stomach acid.

People can also buy H2-receptor blockers, which may decrease the production of stomach acid for up to 12 hours. OTC proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) have a similar effect.

pneumonia.txt,"Foods To Eat and Drink in Pneumonia

4 foods for pneumonia that promote the health of the lungs and help speedy recovery are:

1. Whole Grains

Whole grains like brown rice, oats, and barley have good carbohydrate content to give the energy one needs to recover. The selenium content present in whole grains boosts the immune system as well.

2. Green Leafy Vegetables

Spinach, kale, and other green leafy vegetables contain antioxidants that help with the healing of respiratory infections like pneumonia faster.

3. Protein-rich Foods

Nuts, beans, seeds, chicken, and fish like salmon have anti-inflammatory properties. A protein-rich diet helps build new tissues in the body and replace the damaged lung tissues affected by pneumonia.

4. Yoghurt

Yoghurt has excellent probiotics which promote good bacteria in the gut, and also suppress the growth of pneumonia-causing pathogens

These are the foods to avoid when diagnosed with pneumonia:

1. Processed Meats

According to studies, the nitrites used in the production and preservation of processed meats may cause inflammation and stress in the lungs.

2. Alcohol

Alcohol contains sulphites, which can exacerbate the symptoms of pneumonia. Also, ethanol commonly found in beer, wine, and liquor affects lung cells.

3. Sugary Drinks

According to a study, adults who consume sweetened soft drinks more than 5 times a week are twice likely to have chronic bronchitis. While children are more likely to have asthma. Both chronic bronchitis and asthma can worsen your pneumonia symptoms.

4. Foods High in Sodium

Consuming too much table salt or salty packaged foods can aggravate the symptoms of pneumonia like shortness of breath.
